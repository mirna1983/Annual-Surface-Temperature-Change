# Annual-Surface-Temperature-Change
This repository contains code for performing exploratory data analysis on annual surface temperature change data. The dataset includes historical temperature change values across multiple countries and years. The analysis involves data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The code showcases how to handle missing values, duplicate records, and reshape the data for further insights. The repository serves as a foundation for understanding temperature trends and their variations over time.
